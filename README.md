# NEPS NEPS NEPS NEPS NEPS NEPS NEPS NEPS NEPS
An open source bloat-free CS:GO cheat for Windows, based on Osiris.
You should probably give it a go, as it was in development for about a year.
With many, MANY features added, many, MANY fixes pushed (even the ones CS:GO itself needed), many, MANY optimizations and more!

# NEPS O_O
This software is optimized as far as I was able to keep it clean.
As a proud owner of a 2013 thinkpad, I think I did a so-far-so-good job at making anyone's CS:GO experience with NEPS, at least, not as stuttery and laggy.
